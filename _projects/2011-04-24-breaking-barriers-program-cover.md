In the spring of 2011, I created this design for an event organized by the Chicago Foundation for Women, a local community organization. The theme of the event was Asian American women transforming education, and my whimsical design highlights education and growth.

As someone who enjoys being out in nature and noticing details of the world around me, and loves print books, I appreciated the opportunity to incorporate these elements into the design.

Different versions of this design were used for an e-flyer, a print flyer, and the cover of the program book.
