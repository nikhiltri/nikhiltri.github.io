As a volunteer educator at Rape Victim Advocates, I joined a friend at the Art Institute of Chicago to give a lunchtime public gallery talk the gender box. We discussed common ways people define binary notions of gender, and how these stereotypes are often used to justify the perpetuation of gender-based violence. From this lens, we then looked at two paintings depicting very different images of women: [Salome with the Head of St. John the Baptist](http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/11434) and [The Abduction of the Sabine Women](http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111620).
