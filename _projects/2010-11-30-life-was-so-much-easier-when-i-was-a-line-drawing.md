I created two instructional posters based on the idea of a person who transitioned from being a line drawing to living in three dimensions. I was interested in exploring ideas of not feeling comfortable in one's own body, and the magic of everyday physical movements we take for granted. For this fantastical person, the movements we make every day seem nearly impossible.

I enjoyed making the instructional illustrations on the left side of these posters. I was curious about how to visualize motions that we make all the time to someone who had an adult body, but no idea how to move it.

The series of photos were fun to make, too. I had to walk into this character's life--essentially into my own infant/toddler experience of trying to make a movement that seems mundane to most people.

I modeled these posters after the instructional posters I remembered on the bulletin boards in my elementary and middle schools.

This was part a series that included a [short story]({% post_url 2012-05-31-body %}), a sound piece, and a performance piece.
