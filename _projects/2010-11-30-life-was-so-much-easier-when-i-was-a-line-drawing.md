I created two instructional posters based on the idea of a person who transitioned from being a line drawing to living in three-dimensions. I was interested in exploring the idea of not feeling comfortable in one's own body and of the magic of everyday physical movements we take for granted. For this fantastical person, the movements we make everyday seem nearly impossible.

I enjoyed making the instructional illustrations that were on these posters. I was curious about how to visualize motions that we make all the time without giving them a thought to someone who had an adult body, but had no idea how to move it.

The series of photos were fun to make, too. I had to walk into this characters life--without prior life experiences to try making a movement that seems to mundane to most people.

I modeled these posters after the instructional posters I remembered on the bulletin boards in my elementary and middle schools. 

This was part a series that included a [short story]({% post_url 2012-05-31-body %}) and a sound piece.
