title: Men in the Movement, Resilience
dates: 2014-Present
---
Since 2014, I've been helping to organize and facilitate a series of discussions called Men in the Movement at Resilience, Chicago's largest rape crisis center. The discussions are specifically aimed at getting male-identified people to recognize their roles in stopping sexism and rape culture while also acknowledging the ways men and boys are hurt by them. All discussions have different topics, but have a consistent focus on men's responsibility to end sexual and domestic violence. We've talked about all sort of things, including hypermasculinity and sports, blackness and gender violence, reproductive justice, misogyny in queer and trans communities, porn culture, parenting off the binary, emotional labor, capitalism and masculinity, vulnerability, and so much more. You can learn about upcoming events on Resilience's Facebook page.
