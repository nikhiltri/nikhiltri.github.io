For about a year between 2013-14, I organized a feminist reading group with a group of three other guy friends. We read classic feminist works mostly by women of color, and ate lots of good food togheter. Here's what we read:

* Feminism is for Everybody, bell hooks
* Menâ€™s Work, Paul Kivel
* The Color Purple, Alice Walker
* Selected poems by Audre Lorde
* I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou
* Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology

And [here]({% post_url 2014-12-09-starting-a-mens-feminist-reading-group %}) is a desription of how I got it started.
