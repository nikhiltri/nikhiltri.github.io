title: Decolonizing local history museums workshop
dates: Spring 2018
---
I facilitated a workshop for the Kane DuPage Regional Museum Association, a group of small museums in the Chicago suburbs. I took this opportunity to do a thought exercise to connect the great migration, the WPA highways projects, white flight, and gentrification with a history of the region to paint a picture of anti-blackness in the Chicago suburbs, and tie it to a colonial way of thinking within our selves and our institutions.
