alt: A color pencil illustration of Les Claypool. His unique bass guitar takes up the bottom portion of the work, and his head pops out of the end of the neck. The six strings are swinging around, tuning pegs stick out of the side of his head, and his mouth is open as if he's singing. The bass stands on a stage with the rest of his band quite small below him, speakers line the back of the stage and the front potion of a crowd is seen in front of the stage.

The bassist for the band Primus, Les Claypool was a major inspiration for my bass playing while I was younger. His style was unlike anything else I'd ever heard, and his attitude towards the instrument was free-spirited, and I felt he was unafraid to push his playing and music in new and unique directions.

In this work I tried to capture the quirkiness of his style of playing, and how he seemed to make his bass an extension of his own body, and himself an extension of his bass guitar.
