title: Intersecting Agile and the Antidotes to White Supremacy Culture
dates: November 2019
---
I organized a conference panel discussion along with a few colleagues from the Minneapolis Institute of Art exploring how Scrum—an established framework for addressing complex adaptive problems across industries— could be applied to counteract white supremacy culture in our organizations. We had a really rich discussion and got a lot of great feedback. For confidentiality, we didn't record the session, but you can check out some live tweets that were made during the session [here](https://twitter.com/mimosaishere/status/1192213614989430790).
