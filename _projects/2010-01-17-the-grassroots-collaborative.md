Grassroots Collaborative is a diverse coalition of labor and community organizations working together to win economic and racial justice in Chicago and across the state. The goal of the website was to increase visibility and public awareness of the Collaborative’s work, give visitors a sense of the power of the organization, clearly define what the Collaborative values and why visitors should join their efforts or pay attention to their work, and provide information on past campaigns and current work.

The header image is an illustration I made based on photographs from the Collaborative's campaigns. The image is still used on the protest posters! Grassroots Collaborative works in an urban environment, with and for working-class people. I incorporated these ideas into the aesthetic of the site through icons of the city as well as working-class people. There is a lot of energy around the work the Grassroots Collaborative and its member organizations do, and I tried to reflect that through the choice of colors used on the site. 

The site was developed in [Drupal](http://www.drupal.com), and I did all the design and development of the website, including training staff on how to use the new system to update content. I also set up Google Apps for the organization, and helped staff move their e-mail over from Outlook.
