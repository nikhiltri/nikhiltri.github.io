title: The Key to Happiness
dates: Fall 2003
---
In my mid-twenties, as I was transtioning from college to work I was interested in exploring ideas of value. I believed the onus that society put on personal economics dictated that having money would lead to happiness, but I wasn't so sure. In this film I wanted to explore the questions of what we value, and why, and how what we value is or isn't connected with happiness.
