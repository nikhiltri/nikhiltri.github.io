My personal website served as a way for friends, family, and creative peers to keep up with my creative work and my personal thoughts on the world, as well as a way to let business partners learn about my professional technical skills. 

This site was developed in the [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com) content management system, and I did all the design and development of the website.
