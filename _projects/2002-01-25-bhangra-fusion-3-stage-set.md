title: Bhangra Fusion 3, performance and stage set
dates: 2002
---
[Bhangra Fusion](https://www.facebook.com/bhangrafusion) was one of two national competitions for a South Asian folk dance called Bhangra that young people in the diaspora were transorming into their own unique form of music and dance. In 2002, a group of 16 people from Chicago including myself performed a choreographed bhangra for the competition. The lead choreographer and I designed a stage set for the dance, which included a base platform that we painted the front of to look like a tractor. Words on the tractor actually said ‘Chicago’ in Punjabi. At the end of the performance two people stood on this platform holding another platform on their shoulders, and standing on top of that THAT platform, was me--about 20 feet in the air!
