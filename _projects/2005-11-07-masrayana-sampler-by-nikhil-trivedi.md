title: Masrayana sampler
dates: Fall 2005
---
I composed music and played sitar for a play called “The Masrayana,” a story about a farmer named Gopal Masra in Rajastan. His brother pays off the village-clerk to issue a death certificate in Gopal’s name so that he can inherit the family farm. Gopal’s brother kicks him out of his own house, and he’s left for dead. The story describes his plight, and how he fights back.

I composed a few musical themes that I revisited throughout the show, each based on a different raag. I was awarded a Jeff Citation Award for Best Original Incidental Music for my composition and performance in this show.

> “Completing the environment is composer Nikhil Trivedi’s work on the sitar, which blends with recorded music to create an atmosphere of wonder.” Windy City Times, September 28, 2005

> “Nikhil Trivedi’s atmospheric sitar music, from a platform above the audience, adds polish.”, Chicago Sun-times, September 17, 2005

> “As the drama of Gopal’s quest unfolds, The Masrayana is beautifully accented by Nikhil Trivedi’s sitar music. Trivedi accompanies the play from a picture-perfect perch above the stage.”, The Indian Reporter, October 2005
