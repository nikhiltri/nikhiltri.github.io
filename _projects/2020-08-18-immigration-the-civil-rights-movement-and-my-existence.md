title: Immigration, the Civil Rights Movement, and my existence
dates: August 2020

For the Art Institute blog, I wrote an article linking immigration, the Civil Rights Movement, and art created at the time by Black artists through my parentsâ€™ immigration stories. It was a way to ground the Black uprisings this summer in a long history of organizing in response to racial violence, and it was also a sweet way for me to document my parents' stories as their memories are getting fuzzy.
