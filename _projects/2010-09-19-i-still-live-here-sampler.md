I was blessed to collaborate with some amazing artists on a 20-minute performance work entitled I Still Live Here:

>
> I Still Live Here is the premier work of Chicago-based African diasporic performance project, The Artisans of Alchemy (AOA).  AOA's founder and director, Ni'Ja Whitson choreographs this eclectic and gripping interdisciplinary performance work, that locates and expresses body memory; a gesture boldly traversing the collection of scars and narratives stored between skin.
>
> Supported by original compositions from sound artist nikhil trivedi, site-specific performance for video composed by Whitson, and presented through expressive and dynamically moving bodes, the multimedia landscape of I Still Live Here questions our complicity and personal relationship to violence, connects the horrific reality of “corrective rapes” occurring in staggering numbers in South Africa, to shared histories of, struggles to overcome, and experiences within, collective trauma.
