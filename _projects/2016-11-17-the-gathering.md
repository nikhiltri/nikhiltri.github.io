In November 2016, I joined two other local artists&mdash;Evan La Ruffa and Miguel Aguilar&mdash;at the Art Institute of Chicago to have a conversation facilitated by Kamilah Rashied to explore how creativity informs social transformation. It was in the days after the U.S. election, and I was feeling particularly emotional that night. I shared some questions I had been simmering on about whether museums need to exist at all anymore, and some vulnerable connections I have with colonialism, and I how that informs my activism work. It was a powerful conversation.
