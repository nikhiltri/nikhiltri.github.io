title: Towards an Anti-Oppression Manifesto
dates: November 2015 at MCN
---
At MCN 2015 I gave an Ignite talk that clearly laid out how I think about museums and oppression. I attempted to articlate the connections between cultural institutions and historic traumatic histories, and issued a challenge to my peers to think about how we can take the projects weâ€™re already doing to create anti-oppressive spaces for our visitors.
