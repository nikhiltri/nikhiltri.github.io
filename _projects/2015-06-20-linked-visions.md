Linked Visions was a data visualization we built using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) with admin tools in [Yii PHP](http://www.yiiframework.com). We translated elegant design documentation into a functional interactive that sat in the galleries during the exhibition, and was available on the web after the show closed.
