Linked Visions was a data visualization we build using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) with admin tools in [Yii PHP](http://www.yiiframework.com). We translated elegant design documentation from a designers into a functional interactive that sat in the galleries during the exhibition, and was a available on the web during and after the show closed.
