The summer after my senior year in high school, the band I was in, Backlash, recorded an album of the original songs we had written at the time. We were named after the [Susan Faludi book](https://www.amazon.com/Backlash-Undeclared-Against-American-Women/dp/0307345424), and that summer proved to be a transformative time in my life for a number of reasons. The music sounded like 1986, and it was amazing.
