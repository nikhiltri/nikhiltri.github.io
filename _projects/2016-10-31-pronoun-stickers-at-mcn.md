title: Pronoun stickers at MCN 2016
dates: November 2016

At MCN 2016, I coordinate creating pronoun stickers that people could add to their conference name badges. I found a designer who quickly mocked up the stickers, and I got them printed at moo.com. Take a look at this write-up I did on the MCN blog about how I made them, and how we thought about sharing them at the conference.
