At MCN 2015 I gave an Ignite talk that clearly layed out my thinking about the connections between museums and awful traumatic histories, and why it's imperative that we as museum workers unpack how our institutions have benefited from those histories. A lot of people I talked to in the months afterwards said it resonated with them, and they were fired up (YES!!), but didn't quite know where to start.

At the same conference the following year I wanted to give some specific ideas and practices that people could employ as soon as they went home to work towards this vision. Me and five other colleagues came up with a checklist that can be used before, during and after a tech project to help us gauge how well we're building our systems for as many people as possible.

At the same time, some friends at The Incluseum were working on a similar checklist for, but for thinking about organizations as a whole. There was so much crossover in our work we decided to combine our efforts.
