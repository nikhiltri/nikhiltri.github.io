At MCN 2015 I gave an [Ignite talk]({% post_url 2015-11-05-text-from-my-ignite-talk-at-mcn-2015 %}) that outlined my thinking about the connections between museums and awful, traumatic histories, and why it's imperative that we as museum workers unpack how our institutions have benefited from those histories. A lot of people I talked to in the months after said the talk resonated with them, and they were fired up (YES!!), but didn't quite know where to start.

At the same conference the following year, this tool was presented with specific ideas and practices that people could employ in their work towards this vision. Along with five other colleagues, I came up with a checklist that can be used before, during and after a tech project to help gauge how well we're building our systems for as many people as possible.
