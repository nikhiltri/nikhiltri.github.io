title: Facing Sexual Harassment and Abuse in the Feminizing Museum
dates: July 2018
---
In this article, Aletheia Wittman and I discuss data collected through a survey conducted about incidences of sexual abuse and harassment experienced by museum workers. We explore the results of the survey in relation to the gender-based division of labor and skills among the museum workforce. We look to the responses to this survey as a gauge of how much power women and gender non-conforming people have in their daily work lives in museums and propose actions that could increase empowerment and support. In light of events of the moment, The Journal's publisher has generously made the article available to the general public.
