In February 2017, Kamilah Rashied invited me to join in a feminist conversation to explore the narratives of women in their lives. I talked about my mother's lifelong commitment to gain independence from the patriarchy and the journey that brought her to the United States. She was in the audience that night, and it was the first time she heard me narrate her own story back to her, with my own interpretations of what her story says about her, and how she's affected my life as a pro-feminist man. It was also her 75th birthday, and the whole audience indulged me in singing happy birthday to her!
