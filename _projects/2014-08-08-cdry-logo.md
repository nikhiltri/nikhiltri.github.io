In its first year, I designed the logo and a number of flyers for [Chicago Desi Youth Rising](http://chicagodesiyouthrising.wordpress.com), a summer leadership retreat for young people in Chicago who traced their heritage to South Asia and the diaspora. As a retreat that is committed to empowering youth to combat social inequality, we wanted the logo to portray a sense of power and the diversity of South Asian identities. In later years, different people produced flyers for the program and all the events around it, and it was fun to see the designs I came up with being used in different ways.
