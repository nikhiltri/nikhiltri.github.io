dates: 2014-Present

In January 2014, I organized the first Drinking About Museums, a casual gathering of museum folks in Chicago. We welcomed people working at and with museums from inside and outside our institutions, from all parts of our institutions. The intention was to have space where we can meet each other and create connections, as many of us can be pretty siloed in our work. Since then we've been meeting about once every two months.

Drinking About Museums has been happening in various cities throughout the world for a number of years. Some gatherings are loosely structured like ours, while others have agendas and presentations. Here are some other organizer’s perspectives on it: [Koven Smith](http://kovenjsmith.com/archives/1127) and [Ed Rodley](https://exhibitdev.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/on-drinking-about-museums/). In 2015 I began co-organizing the events with Taylor Peterson.
