title: Uncovering white supremacy culture in museum work
dates: March 2020

Along with few museum friends Hannah Heller and Joanne Jones-Rizzi, I wrote an article describing the ways white supremacy culture operates in museums. Drawing from Kenneth Jones and Tema Okun's work that names the cultural attributes of White supremacy in organizations, we took a few of the characteristics that resonated strongly in our work as educators and community builders and unpacked what they specifically look like in museums and what their impacts are.
