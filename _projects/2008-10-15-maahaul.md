maahaul was a collective I organized of Indian Classical musicians in Chicago who learned from each other and created opportunities to perform and educate others. The main function of the maahaul website was to give Chicago concert-goers information on classical music concerts and events. I used the aesthetic of the classical instrument I play, the sitar, to inspire the design of the site. The repeated curves in the header image were inspired by the instrument's frets, the horizontal lines were inspired by the instrument's strings, and the short vertical bars between the navigation elements were inspired by the string's tuning pegs. I did all the design and development of the website.
