Over the course of a year a half, a small team of designers and developers worked in partnership with an agency to redesign the Art Institute of Chicago's website. We thought holistically about our entire web presence, and in the process brought together eight different systems to serve under one umbrella and archived 100 microsites. It was a huge undertaking that proved to be well worth the effort.
