At Museums and the Web a colleague and I did a demonstration of the uses of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a powerful data visualization library. To address the questions I'd been asking for some time: how have museums benefited from slavery, I pulled publicly available museum data of the creation dates of objects in the African collections of a handful of different art museums, and put them side-by-side with when enslaved people were removed from the African continent. Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikhiltri/african-collections-transatlantic-slave-trade-vis).
