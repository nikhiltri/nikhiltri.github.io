title: Visitors of Color discussion guide
dates: 2016

For a number of museum conferences in 2016 I conducted teach-ins centered around a post from the Visitors of Color blog and a single question: how has your institution benefitted from slavery? Participants said it was a useful space that brought to light information about their institutions that they hadn't considered before. I've shared the discussion guide on our blog so other can conduct the teach-ins themselves.
