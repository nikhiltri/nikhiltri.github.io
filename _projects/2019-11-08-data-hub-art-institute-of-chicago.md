As part of the artic.edu website redesign, we created a central data repository for all of our public content that can feed the website, our mobile apps, in-gallery interactives, and an eventual public API. Our Data Hub collects all our public data in one place, serve it all up through a uniform API, and make the content collected from all our platforms searchable in a single place. Watch a talk I gave about the project at MCN 2019.
