During MASS Action 2018, I took over the Curated Outfitters Instagram account to post cute fashion photos of attendees. There was so much to document and so little time, I captured only a slice of the on-point cuteness that was present at the convening. I posted most of the photos in the days after I can home, so it was a nice way to say goodbye to all the new people I met and dear friends I got to connect with while there.
