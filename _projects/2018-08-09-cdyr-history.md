As part of Chicago Desi Youth Rising's annual retreat, I co-organized and co-facilitated a workshop creating space to imagine and outline a radical history of South Asia. Our intention was to explore erasures that have existed over time due to colonialism, genocide, and war, and create alliances with other surviving communities of traumatic histories including slavery. I've been a supporter of Chicago Desi Youth Rising since the project started in 2014 (my partner was one of the co-founders, and I designed their logo!), so I was thrilled to bring the facilitation work that I do in museum communities to my radical South Asian community.
