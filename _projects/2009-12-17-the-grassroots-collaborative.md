Grassroots Collaborative is a diverse coalition of labor and community organizations working together to win economic and racial justice in Chicago and across Illinois. The goal of the website was to increase visibility and public awareness of the Collaborativeâ€™s work, give visitors a sense of the power of the organization, clearly define the Collaborative's values and why visitors should join their efforts or pay attention to their work, and provide information on past campaigns and current work.

The header image is an illustration I made based on photographs from the Collaborative's campaigns. The image is still used on their protest posters!

The site was developed in [Drupal](http://www.drupal.com), and I did all the design and development of the website, including training staff on how to use the new system to update content. I also set up Google Apps for the organization and helped staff move their e-mail over from Outlook.
