dates: Summer/Fall 2016

In the fall of 2016, [Suse Cairns](https://museumgeek.xyz/) and I exchanged a series of letters over postal mail exploring the idea of structural change in museums and how it happens. We talked about a lot--connecting museums to a larger landscapes of institutions, structural change as a process of healing, and how transformation must be aligned with other social liberation movements.

It was an interesting conversation because we both think about institutional transformation quite a lot, but we come from very different perspectives. It challenged me to think hard about my ideas in order to articulate them as clearly as I could. I learned so much from our exchange, and she told me she did to.
