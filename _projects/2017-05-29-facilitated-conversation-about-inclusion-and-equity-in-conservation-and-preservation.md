title: Facilitated Conversation About Inclusion and Equity in Conservation and Preservation
dates: May 2017
---
76 conservators gathered prior to the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works’ Annual Meeting for a historical convening. The purpose was to create a sense of solidarity among colleagues to influence the power dynamics in the conservation field and to begin to develop a shared vision for pursuing a more inclusive and equitable professional practice for the future of conservation. Sanchita Balachandran, a co-organizer of the convening shares: “we wanted to imagine and create a new kind of space that is limitless in response to the kind of oppressive limiting that has been a burden of our world and its history. This act is to say we have power to change, we have power to demand and make change.” From this foundation, we hoped to give attendees an opportunity to think about how to effect change in their professional practices through both short-term and long-term actions. As part of my role in facilitating the conversation, I gave a mini-speech to open the discussion. I shared the text of the speech on my blog.
