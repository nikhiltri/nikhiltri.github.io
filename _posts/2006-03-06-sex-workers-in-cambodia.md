I heard a somewhat disturbing report on [sex workers in Cambodia](http://outervoices.org/an-exploration-of-cambodia/) last night on NPR. My partner said she heard similar stories before, but you never really understand the depth of a problem til it's layed out for you. Me anyway...

I saw [Dil Chahta Hai](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292490/) over the weekend. Now I know what all the hype was about. It was a good movie! It wasn’t over dramatic for no reason, the characters experienced shit that made sense, and you could empathize with. “Whoa, you mean the storyline was believable?” Don’t get me wrong, at certain points of the movie, you knew EXACTLY what was going to happen, cause it IS still a Bollywood movie. But for the most part, it was pretty darn good. I put some guitar chords to some of the songs, too, so that was fun. “Jaane kyon?”
