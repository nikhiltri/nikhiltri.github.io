A buddy at work’s been asking me and my buddy Sachin for a general shak recipe for a while, so he can try making chicken and lamb Indian-style. We finally got around to writing it up for him today, check it out:

> 
> General Shak recipe, serves 3-4:
> 
> 2 cups of your main ingredient
> 1 small onion or half a big onion, chopped
> 1/2 bell pepper, chopped
> 2 small garlic cloves, minced
> 1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
> 1 habenero pepper, finely chopped
> 2 plum tomatoes, or one regular tomato, chopped
> 1 quarter of a lemon
> 1 teaspoon mustard seed
> 1 teaspoon cumin seed (optional)
> 1 teaspoon coriander
> 1 teaspoon chili powder
> 1 teaspoon turmeric
> 1 teaspoon sugar
> 1 teaspoon salt
> 
> 1. Cook whatever the main ingredient is. In our case, we pressure cook our beans and vegetables until they’re tender enough to be ready to eat. I usually heat up 1 cup of beans that’ll expand to about 2 cups.
> 
> 2. Heat up oil and mustard seed (and cumin seed if you wish) in a pan until the mustard seed starts popping.
> 
> 3. Add onion, pepper, garlic, jalapeno, and habenero pepper to the oil. Let them cook until the onions are clear.
> 
> 4. Add tomatoes. Mix and let cook for another 5 minutes or so.
> 
> 5. Add main ingredient. Mix and let cook for 5 minutes or so.
> 
> 6. Add coriander, chili powder, turmeric, sugar, and salt. Mix and let cook for 5-10 minutes. Add salt to taste, to help bring out the flavor of the other spices.
> 
> 7. At this point the shak should pretty much be done. Squeeze lemon juice into shak, mix and let simmer for a few minutes.
> 
> 8. Serve and enjoy.
