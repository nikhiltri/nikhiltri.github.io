My buddy Jim and his wife Chi Mei came over for dinner Monday night, WITH THEIR NEW BABY. How can you deny that this is the cutest thing you’ve ever seen?

Her name is Lauren Kathrine Schneider. Jim was like the first among my close group of friends to get married, and he’s now the first to have a baby. So we’re all in feel-good mode about it, and rightfully so. Him and Chi Mei seem really happy, and their daughter’s ADORABLE.

I’m going to this dudes house in Naperville to re-record some of the parts to the songs I’ve been working on for that short film. Hopefully I’ll be one-take-jay tonight and we can get it all done fairly quickly. We’ll see.
