Navaratri’s starting next week, and [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/holydays/navaratri.shtml)’s got on nice little article about it. My family’s been fasting during the nine days of Navaratri for as long as I can remember, and recently I’ve been doing the fasting more rigorously with my parents. It’s interesting how I learn more and more about fasting, and why we fast, every year. Not in the sense that my fasting becomes more strict at all, but in the sense that I’m more in tune with why I’m fasting, and how that affects my relationship with God. We’ll see what I learn this year.

Check this out, too. The [Guru Granth Sahib](http://www.sikhs.org/english/eg_index.htm) translated in English. It's on.
