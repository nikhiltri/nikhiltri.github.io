So I did some research, and I THINK the musical instrument that’s played by the elder man in that scene in the movie Hero is called a [guqin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin). It's a Chinese instrument that dates back some 3000, and from what I can gather, it does have a developed, highly refined classical form. I’d be interested in learning more about the style, and checking out a concert. I’ll keep my eyes peeled and post info up on here if I find anything.

Have you seen Google’s new [print search](http://print.google.com/)? You can search the text of a book, similarly to how you can on Amazon, but it's specifically the text of a book, and not in addition to searching titles and authors. It's pretty cool, and perhaps going towards the goal of setting up an ‘online Library of Congress?’ We’ll see where Google tries to go, and how intellectual property advocates take to the new technology...
