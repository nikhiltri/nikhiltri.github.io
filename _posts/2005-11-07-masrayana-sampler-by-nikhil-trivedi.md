In fall of 2005 I played sitar for a play called “The Masrayana,” a story about a farmer in Rajastan, Gopal Masra, who’s brother pays off the village-clerk to issue a death certificate in Gopal’s name so that he may inherit the family farm. Gopal’s brother kicks him out of his own house, and he’s left for dead. The story describes his plight, and how he fights back. I was awarded a Jeff Citation Award for Best Original Incidental Music for my composition and performance in this show.
