Just watching the third debate tonight, I heard for the first time the term "pro-abortion." used by McCain, it conjures up nasty images of people pushing for others to have abortions. Wondering if I was out of touch about pro-choice-pro-life terminologies, I did a Google search for "pro-abortion" and only [one website](http://www.allaboutpopularissues.org/pro-abortion.htm) came up, which describes pro-abortion as basically pro-choice. The website was run by another site call allaboutgod.com.

Are McCain and other conservatives trying to use the term "pro-abortion" instead of "pro-choice" to make those of us who support a woman's right to choose look like monsters who want to murder babies? If so, aaauuuuugh... If not, where did this term come from?
