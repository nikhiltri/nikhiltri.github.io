In the past, I've mentioned to a few people the phenomenon of the sun showing a quick green spot as it's setting, due to waves of light bending in the earth's atmosphere. NASA's got an animated gif of a video someone in Italy took of the phenomenon, [check it out](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap070129.html).

I was in CT this weekend, and I'm still here working from a Starbucks right now cause they have wireless. How sweet is that? Using the laptop my work provided me, I'm able to connect to my Linux box at my office from just about anywhere and still work a full 8 hour day of coding, developing, and testing Java and database code, like I do every other day of the 40+ hour week (since I have a job that requires such, but that should be no surprise). _Crazy!!!_
