So about a month ago, I found out I got nominated for a [Jeff Award](http://www.jeffawards.org/) for Best Original Incedental Music for the sitar accompaniment I did in Rasaka Theatre’s The Masrayana last fall. Last night was at the ceremony, and holy crap, I [WON](http://www.jeffawards.org/?action=current_citations#21)! I didn’t event know what to say. The whole experience has been crazy. I had such a blast playing for the play, it all just came so naturally, and then to get nominated for an award for it, and to win? Holy crap... It's on.
