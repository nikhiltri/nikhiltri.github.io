Today’s the last day of Navratri, a nine-day holiday my family and I celebrate every year. Here’s some info on the holiday, and the manifestation of God we worship over the nine days:

> 
> "What’s the Significance of Navratri?
> 
> During Navaratri, we invoke the energy aspect of God in the form of the universal mother, commonly referred to as "Durga," which literally means the remover of miseries of life. She is also referred to as "Devi" (goddess) or "Shakti" (energy or power). It is this energy, which helps God to proceed with the work of creation, preservation and destruction…
> 
> Why Worship the Mother Goddess?
> 
> We think this energy is only a form of the Divine Mother, who is the mother of all, and all of us are her children. ... Just as a child finds all these qualities in his or her mother, similarly, all of us look upon God as mother. Hinduism … gives so much importance to the mother aspect of God because we believe that mother is the creative aspect of the absolute.
> 
> Why Nine Nights & Days?
> 
> Navaratri is divided into sets of three days to adore different aspects of the supreme goddess. On the first three days, the Mother is invoked as powerful force called Durga in order to destroy all our impurities, vices and defects. The next three days, the Mother is adored as a giver of spiritual wealth, Lakshmi, who is considered to have the power of bestowing on her devotees the inexhaustible wealth. The final set of three days is spent in worshipping the mother as the goddess of wisdom, Saraswati. In order to have all-round success in life, we need the blessings of all three aspects of the divine mother; hence, the worship for nine nights."
