Are you sick of having to register for random websites just to get access to ONE piece of information? Worrying that you’re gonna get inundated with spam mail as a result, and having to fill out the same form over and over and over again? So am I, and so are the geniuses who made [bugmenot.com](http://www.bugmenot.com/). Search for a website who’s registration you’d rather not participate in, and hopefully they’ll have a generic username and password you can use. SWEEEEEEET.
