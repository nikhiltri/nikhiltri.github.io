So the [Art Institute of Chicago](http://www.artic.edu) has new hours for the summer, check it out:

> 
> NEW SUMMER MUSEUM HOURS &#8211;  JUNE 3 TO LABOR DAY
> 10:30 a.m to 5:00 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
> 10:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Thursday and Friday _(Free after 5:00 p.m.)_
> 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Saturday, Sunday
> 

check that, **FREE** on Thursday and Friday evenings from 5-9p. What does that mean? It means that you can meet up with a hot date after work-ish, check out some nice art at the museum and talk about how the artist expresses discontent and and heart-wrenching pain through their use of color and shadow, then grab a bite to eat and maybe hit up a bar afterwards.

No need to thank me, i'm just doing my part to contribute to the greater good of society.
