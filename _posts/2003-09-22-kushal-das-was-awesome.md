Okay, two words. “Holy”, “Crap.” I went to the Kushal Das show yesterday afternoon with Avani, and it was freaking awesome. Kushal Uncle (no relation, just a term of endearment) was WAILING on the sitar. It was very humbling to see such an amazing performance. You realize even though you may have come so far in your own musical talents, you have yet so far to go.

Maninder ended up never making it out to the show cause his parents were in town, and when I was talking to the artists after the show I totally forgot to send some of his love their way. Oooof, so my bad. But after the show Avani and I got a bite to eat at this Armenian restaurant off Michigan, and then called it a night. But maaaan, what a great show!
