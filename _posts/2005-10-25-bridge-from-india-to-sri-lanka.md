I’m reading the Ramayan right now, and in the story, Hanuman and a group of troupes are searching all over India for Sita. They get word that She was kidnapped by Ravarn, and is being kept in his palace on an island called ‘Lanka’ 600 miles off India’s southern coast. So I was asking people lately if ‘Lanka’ is the same as ‘Sri Lanka,’ or if today’s island was given its name more recently, as part of India’s Hindu-right government’s efforts to make India more of a Hindu-nation. When my buddy at work told me that NASA had captured satellite photos of a natural bridge between India and Sri Lanka, as it’s depicted in the Ramayan, damn, that’s pretty amazing. Check out [google maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=sri+lanka&ll=9.125148,79.512177&spn=0.839843,1.649048&t=k&hl=en) and the following ‘upside-side’ satellite images.
