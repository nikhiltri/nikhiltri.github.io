So Saturday I saw karsh kale at the hot house, and show was TIIIIIIIIGHT. He was switchin between his tabla’s and a drum set, and he had a bassist, a laptop keyboard dude, a guitarist, a dude on keyboards, harmonium and vocals that WAAAAALED. It was really cool. He was doin his fresh style of Indian mellowed out Drum n’ Bass ish. And the dudes on vocals was just smooth as hell. Seein it live makes it all the fresher.

I’m getting ready for some gigs coming up. I’ll keep you all posted.
