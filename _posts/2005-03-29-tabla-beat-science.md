[Tabla Beat Science](http://www.tablabeatscience.com/) is coming to the House of Blues Sunday. I’ve never seen them before, but from what I’ve heard from people who checked out their show at the Vic a few years ago, they put on a GREAT show.

In other news, it's GORGEOUS out today. Its like 70 degrees! I went out without a jacket OR my orange hat. CRAZY. I didn’t realize it was so nice til like 1:30p though. Worthless. Otherwise I would have spent my lunch break outside in front of my building reading. Sigh that sounds like a beautiful idea about now...
