NASA's Cassini satellite recently took some detailed shots of [Saturn’s moon](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4197686.stm). The moon’s far enough from the sun that’s its basically a big ball of ice, but some of the shots show that its got some pretty cool characteristics, like HUGE cracks in its surface that stretch 80 MILES LONG that they suspect may be releasing steam from hotter substances below the surface. Could you image that? Standing on a planet made of ice, looking to the sky and seeing Saturn as probably 10 times the size of the sun, and standing in front of crack that stretches from Chicago to Rockford, releasing steam from its depths? The universe makes some pretty amazing things...
