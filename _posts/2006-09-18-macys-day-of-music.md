This weekend I performed at [Macy's Day of Music](http://www.cso.org/res/pdf/dayofmusic_0607.pdf), a free, all-day event at the Chicago Symphony Center where they had four rooms/theaters of music happening simultaneously all day. I was set up in the rotunda, which was a big room with a big circle staircase in the middle. So I was set up in a corner, with people seated on either side of the staircase. I think it went pretty well, there was a pretty good sized crowd there, and from what I can tell, the people who were closer to me seemed to be engaged in the music, so that's sweet! But the sitar is such a quiet instrument, so it was good that I was mic'd, but even though, I think people further away from me may have had a harder time hearing me. I didn't realize how big of a deal this event was, until last weekend when Eric called me asking me if I was performing at the CSO this past Saturday, cause he had seen an ad in the Chicago Tribune. _HELLO_! There was also an ad in the Reader, and the CSO included me in a [press release](http://www.cso.org/main.taf?p=7,1,2,4,14) they sent out about the event. Check out the excerpt below:

> "_World music and jazz fans won’t want to miss several special performances at this year’s Macy’s Day of Music. At 4:00 p.m., audiences can hear India’s most popular instrument when sitar musician Nikhil Trivedi performs in the Rotunda. Mr. Trivedi is founder of Maahaul, a collective of classical Indian music students. He has studied with sitar luminaries such as Rajan Sachdev and Ustad Shujaat Khan._"
