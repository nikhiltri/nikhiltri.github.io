Aight kids, it’s ALMOST on…

I’m at the airport in Amsterdam right now, in a little internet cafe thing. The flight here SUCKED. I’m used to cramped seats on planes, but this was crazy. It was so cramped on there. And this kid behind me kept kicking the back of my chair, and putting his feet up against it and just PUSHING. So that was frustrating…

But half of the flight is over. We’ve got a four hour layover, then we’re off to the motherland. I was sitting next to two other students on the study abroad program on the way there. So we got to talk and get to know each other a bit. So that was cool, cause I don’t really feel like I know anyone on the trip yet. That will all change soon though, I’m sure.

I tried testing out my minidisc/microphone set up on the plane on the way here, but I couldn’t hear a thing over the loud airplane hummmmmmmmmmm. So I’ll proly hit that up on the layover.

I can’t tell you too much about Amsterdam, outside of the fact that the airport looks pretty cool. They’ve got these lounges with cool looking chairs that look comfortable as hell compared to the airplane seats. So I’m totally gonna hit that up. Everything’s white and really airy. And all the announcements they make are in a bunch of languages. But in the international terminal, that’s to be expected, I guess. I heard an announcement before that said ‘Mr. Blah Blah Blah travelling from Dubai to New York, please blah blah blah.

Well I’m off… I’m almost out of time and my computer’s binging…
