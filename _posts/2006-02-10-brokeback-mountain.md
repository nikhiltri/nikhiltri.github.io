I just saw Brokeback Mountain for the second time yesterday. And much to my surprise, it’s still just as sad, and killed me emotionally just as much as it did the first time I saw it, if not moreso. It's a GREAT movie, but SOOOO SAAAAAD. I can’t even say anything about it. The characters are so real, and the way they’re intimate with each other remind me so much of my own relationship, and imagining myself going through what they’ve gone through kills me that much more. Them being two men becomes transparent in these intimate moments, it's only when they have to “explain themselves” to the rest of the world that their sexuality becomes an issue, which is even MORE messed up. Big heavy sigh, saaaad, saaad movie...
