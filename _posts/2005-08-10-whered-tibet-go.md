I was looking for a map of New Delhi, so of course I consulted my latest buddy Google. But alas, they have satellite maps of every spot in the world, but they don’t have road maps of any major cities in India, or any other part of Asia yet. But while I was looking, I noticed that Google doesn’t show a designation for the country of [Tibet](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=india&ll=29.113775,85.517578&spn=21.602394,31.645020&t=h&hl=en). What’s up with that? In relation to Nepal, [this](http://www.cots.com.cn/handbook/img/tibet_map.jpg) is where Tibet lies. I wonder why Google doesn’t have it denoted. Any ideas?

Ahhh, if life were only that simple again. Worthless.
