Check out this article talking about how IBM is encouraging their employees to [get teaching certificates and become public school teachers](http://www.newsday.com/technology/wire/sns-ap-ibm-education,0,664925.story?coll=sns-ap-technology-headlines). go IBM. They’re expecting the majority of their employees who take advantage of their new program to be older employees close to retiring age. I’d be curious to see how it actually pans out.
