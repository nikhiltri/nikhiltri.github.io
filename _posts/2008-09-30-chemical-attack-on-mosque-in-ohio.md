This is horrible, and absolutely disgusts me:

> 
> On Friday, September 26, the end of a week in which thousands of copies of Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West&#8212;the fear-mongering, anti-Muslim documentary being distributed by the millions in swing states via DVDs inserted in major newspapers and through the U.S. mail&#8212;were distributed by mail in Ohio, a "chemical irritant" was sprayed through a window of the Islamic Society of Greater Dayton, where 300 people were gathered for a Ramadan prayer service. The room that the chemical was sprayed into was the room where babies and children were being kept while their mothers were engaged in prayers. This, apparently, is what the scare tactic political campaigning of John McCain's supporters has led to&#8212;Americans perpetrating a terrorist attack against innocent children on American soil.

> Although there has been no direct link established between Obsession and the events in Ohio, the documentary is clearly having an effect. The founder of the Interfaith Youth Core received a call from a Lutheran pastor, who told him that "his congregation has been involved in several interfaith projects, including allowing a group of Muslims to use the church for worship on Friday evenings while their new mosque was being built. ... But recently, this pastor has fielded several angry phone calls from congregants condemning the decision to allow 'dangerous people' to use church space. Why these calls now ... Last week, his community received the film 'Obsession' in the Sunday newspaper.

Yet, the police covering the case don't see it as a hate crime?

I can't even find words to say about this. 

Our government and media has brewed so much hate against the muslim community in our country. there's always an ambiguously defined "other" that our government uses as a fear tactic, so it can go on with whatever hate-filled plans it has, and for years now they've been trying to frame the muslim community as that "other". Post-9/11, we were worried about "rogue"-governments getting access to chemical and biological weapons to attack the us with. Now who's being attacked with chemical weapons, and where? The same attacks our government is waging overseas is being replicated and made domestically on the same group they've defined as hating America. I'm disgusted, and fuming right now.

Moreover, _no one's_ covering this story. It took me forever to get some info about this. I guess Palin's latest fumbles are more important?
