At my work we have a legacy system running on it's last legs. I spent some time figuring out how to export data from it, and [documented it](http://nikhiltri.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/exporting-data-from-helix/) for other's to reference. Here's an except:

<bockquote>
"We have a legacy application that serves our Imaging department that runs on <a title="Helix" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_(database)" target="_blank">Helix</a> (Rade version 5.2). Helix is a "visual" application development environment that hasn't been in active development for over 10 years and only runs on Mac OS9 (edit: <a title="until recently" href="http://www.qsatoolworks.com/tlw/2013/jun10.html" target="_blank">until recently</a>). Our application isn't in active use, but is still queried for legacy information. Documented here is how I exported data from Helix to import it into a more practical database, like MySQL."
