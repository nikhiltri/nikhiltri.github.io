Honorable mention in [LesClaypool.com](http://www.lesclaypool.com)â€™s Art Contest ([Printscreen](http://www2.nikhiltrivedi.com/sites/default/files/lesClaypoolArtContest.gif)).

Les Claypool the bassist for the band Primus, and was a major point of inspiration for my bass playing while I was younger. His style was unlike anything else I'd ever heard, and his attitude towards the instrument was free-spirited, and I felt he was unafraid to push his playing and music in new and unique directions.

In this work I tried to capture the quirkiness of his style of playing, and how he seems to make his bass an extension of his body, and himself an extension of his bass guitar.
