Full website design and development

The Grassroots Collaborative is a diverse coalition of labor and community organizations working together to win economic and racial justice in Chicago and across the state. The Collaborative works to unite disenfranchised people around their common interests to create a larger force for systemic change and to improve all of their lives. The goal of the website is to increase visibility and public awareness 
of the Collaborativeâ€™s work, give visitors a sense of the power of the organization, clearly define what the Collaborative values and why visitors should join their efforts or pay attention to their work, and provide information on past campaigns and current work.

I designed the header image based on photographs from the Collaborative's campaigns, and created a colorful page design that spotlights the people their work impacts and who are responsible. The Grassroots Collaborative works in an urban environment, with and for working-class people. I incorporated these ideas into the aesthetic of the site through icons of the city as well as working-class people. There is a lot of energy around the work the Grassroots Collaborative and its member organizations do, and I tried to reflect that through the choice of colors used on the site. 

The site was developed on the [Drupal](http://www.drupal.com) content management system, and I did all the design and development of the website, including training staff on how to use the new system to update content on the website themselves. I also set up Google Apps for the organization, and helped staff move their e-mail over to the centralized e-mail too.
