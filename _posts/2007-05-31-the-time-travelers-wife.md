I just finished reading [The Time Traveler's Wife](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&#38;keywords=a%20time%20travelers%20wife&#38;tag=nikhiltrivedi-20&#38;index=books&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nikhiltrivedi-20&l=ur2&o=1) and _good Lord_ what a good book! It's about a woman, Clare, who's in love with a man, Henry, who has a genetic disorder that causes him to uncontrollably time travel. Concept alone, what a great premise for a book. The result of this relationship though, is that she first meets him when she's six and he's in his forties, cause he travels back in time to her childhood home. And he only meets her for the first time when he's in his late twenties. She already knows a lot about him and his future, cause she's known him her whole life, but to him she's a total stranger. The book takes their relationship from their very beginnings, all the way through them getting married and living the rest of their lives together. Sheena and I were reading it together, and I think we both really connected with the book cause the feelings they have about Henry randomly leaving for unknown lengths of time are similar to the feelings we have being in a long-distant relationship. We're constantly leaving, and constantly waiting to see each other again. That was like. Their entire lives. I finished the book in a week, staying up late two nights to just read. It's really well written, and the characters are so well developed, that by the end of the book you can hardly believe this is a work of fiction, existing in a world that the author created in her mind. It also takes place in Chicago, so there are a ton of references to places and streets and neighborhoods that I'm familiar with, so that was fun to read, too!

_Siiigh_ Anyway. Other than the escape the books given me for the past week, things have been okay. Today's my cous's birthday (happy birthday, bro!) so we'll proly be doing something later tonight. Family drama is a cold front slowly moving in the from west, which is annoying and frustrating. But I'm one optimistic guy, so I'm sure everything will work out, one way or another. I was in CT this weekend visiting for her brother's birthday. We saw Spiderman 3, which was so-so, played some games, ate good food, and just hung out. It was fun. We also did some wedding stuff while I was out there, which was helpful.
