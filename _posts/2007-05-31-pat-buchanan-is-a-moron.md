From a [column](http://townhall.com/columnists/column.aspx?UrlTitle=the_dark_side_of_diversity&#38;ns=PatrickJBuchanan&#38;dt=05/01/2007&#38;page=full&#38;comments=true) that the man wrote himself:

> 
> "Almost no attention has been paid to the fact that Cho Seung-Hui was not an American at all, but an immigrant, an alien. Had this deranged young man who secretly hated us never come here, 32 people would heading home from Blacksburg for summer vacation.
> 
> What was Cho doing here? How did he get in?
> 
> Cho was among the 864,000 Koreans here as a result of the Immigration Act of 1965, which threw the nation's doors open to the greatest invasion in history, an invasion opposed by a majority of our people. Thirty-six million, almost all from countries whose peoples have never fully assimilated in any Western country, now live in our midst.
> 
> Cho was one of them."

I don't even know how to start talking about this. I haven't mentioned the VT shooting on my site at all since it happened, cause I can't even come up with the words to describe how I feel about what happened. My heart and my prayers seriously go out to the families of the victims, and the family of the kid who did the shootings. I don't think I'm in any sort of position to offer any more than my condolences, and my heartfelt wishes for their health and safety.

So does it piss me off to hear people blaming the entire immigrant community for the VT murders? **Yes.** You have to be kidding me, not only is that extremely offensive, but it's completely ignorant. Pat Buchanan makes it sound like the immigration act of '65 was a sci-fi movie that brought flesh-eating Koreans to Virginia to destroy the lives of humbly white-folk. That act brought my parents to the US. It brought Sheena's parents to the US. It brought Tolgar's parents to the US. It brought Paras's parents to the US. It brought Dhubha's parents to the US. It brought Jay's parents to the US. Are our families here to commit hainus crimes? **No.** 

Many of the Asian-Americans who came to the US as a result of the immigrantion act of '65 were educated professionals&#8212;doctors, engineers, nurses, scientists, etc. That's where the whole [model minority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_minority) problem was born, and this 'mass invasion' was what resulted in [brain drain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_drain) from many of the countries he speaks of&#8212;the loss of a countries educated classes to emigration to other countries, historically the US and Canada. Does that sounds like a class of mass-murderes to you? The anger I feel when I read his article is indescribable. 

In the latter half of the article, he goes on listing all the people who've committed hainus crimes who were also of an Asian, Middle-Eastern, African, or some other non-European decent (i.e., flesh-eating aliens). Ignoring that [one dude who kept heads in his fridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), that one other guys who [brainwashed people to commit murders for him](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson), that one other guy that [dressed up like a clown and buried murdered children in his basement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Gacy), the [leader of that sect in Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koresh), and those [kids from Columbine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold). 

Needless to say, trying to link race with horrible murders is completely senseless. Just as many infantile suggestions can be made about trying to profile people with extreme mental illness into any other particular categories, be it race, class, gender, family upbringing, or what have you, among the majority classes of each category or minority. But there just isn't a certain type of murderer. trying to find as much breeds racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, and all the fear-based separations we already live with in our society. Pat Buchanan _seriously_ needs to get his head out of his a&#8212;.
