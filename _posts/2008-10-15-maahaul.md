Full website design and development

maahaul is a collective of Indian Classical musicians in Chicago who learn from each other and create opportunities to perform and educate others. The main function of the maahaul website is to give Chicago concert-goers the most up-to-date information on classical music concerts and events. I used the aesthetic of the classical instrument I play, the sitar, to inspire the design of the site. The repeated curves in the header image were inspired by the instrument's frets, the horizontal lines were inspired by the instument's strings, and the short vertical bars between the navigation elements were inspired by the string's pegs.
