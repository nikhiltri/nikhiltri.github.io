Today is a holiday called Guru Purnima, a celebration of our teachers. If you do a [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=guru+purnima) on "Guru Purnima", you'll find a lot of heavily spiritual discussion on the significance and meaning of the holiday. But for me, I call my music teachers "Guru." Not because I consider them God, at least any moreso than I consider all living creatures to be a living part of the divine. But because they bless me with knowledge about music, the world, and myself; and for me, the process of learning is spiritual in and of itself.
 
So I'd like to observe this day by paying respects to my musical gurus, [Rajanji](http://www.indianmusicinstitute.com/) and [Khansahib](http://www.shujaatkhan.com/), as well as anyone else I have crossed paths with that has helped me learn more about myself and the world. Shubh Guru Purnima!
