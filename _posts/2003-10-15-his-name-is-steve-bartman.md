Dude,

What’s with the guy who caught Alou’s ball last night in the 8th inning, spurring off 8 unanswered runs by the Marlins’s to win the game? I have mixed feelings about the mass hysteria about this guy. On one hand, I think its ****ty that he caught that ball, cause we would have been in a much better position to close out the inning had we had that out. But on the other hand, if I were in his seat, would I have done the same thing? He was probably staring up at the ball, didn’t see Alou coming at him, and before he knew it, he had a leftfielder having a temper tantrum in front of him, a pitcher screaming bloody murder, and a bunch of beer being thrown at him. ouch.

But I do think it’s wrong that Smoking Gun published his name . People in Chicago already want to track him down and beat the hell out of him, and this surely isn’t helping his situation. Granted he messed with the game, but dragging him into an alley, stealing his wallet and jewelry, and beating the crap out of him til he says “Uncle” isn’t gonna solve anything…

Anyway, hopefully the Cubs will wrap it up tonight.
