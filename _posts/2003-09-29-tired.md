The week begins… This weekend I didn’t do too much of anything. Navratri, my family’s annual nine-day religious holiday, started Friday. So along with the beginning of the holiday came the beginning of the nine-day fasting. So I was pretty tired all weekend. Each day we restrict ourselves to fruits and nuts all day, and then we have one meal at night. But on Saturday we were only to drink juice all day without any meal. So that pretty much shot all my energy all weekend. So I spent a lot of time at home working on the new design for the site you’re viewing right now. It’s on.

Saturday morning I got up early and went to this leadership, outdoorsy, team-building retreat for work, and that was AWESOME. For the second half of the retreat we partnered up and had to go on this high-ropes course 2-3 stories above the ground. That was sweeeEEEEeeeet. I was telling my mom about some of the activites we had to do up there, and she was like ‘I don’t know how you do these thing. If it were me I would have just AHHH!’ in her unique accent. Lol, that was funny.

Anyway, I won’t be the one left behind, cause I can’t be the king of the world if I’m slave to the grind. (c) Skid Row.
