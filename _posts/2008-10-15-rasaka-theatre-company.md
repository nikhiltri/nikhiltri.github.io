Website development
 
Rasaka Theatre is Chicago’s only South Asian theater company. I developed the HTML and CSS based on an design for the website created by a graphic designer, then implemented the design on a content management system, enabling the site owners to quickly and easily make changes to the website. In addition, I implemented specific technologies to improve data sharing and communication among board and staff, including the use of Basecamp, a project management tool, and Google document-sharing applications.
