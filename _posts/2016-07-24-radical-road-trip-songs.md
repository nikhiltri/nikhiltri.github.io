All across the town

The racist-ass cops we don't need them
We don't need them
We don't need them
The racist-ass cops we don't need them
All across the town

The people blocking highways shut it down
Shut it down
Shut it down
The people blocking highways shut it down
All across the town

The people on the march say "Water is life!"
"Water is life!"
"Water is life!"

All across the town

The leaders of the march say "no justice!" (No peace!)
"No justice!" (No peace!)
"No justice!" (No peace!)

All across the town

The marshals on the march say "please turn here"
