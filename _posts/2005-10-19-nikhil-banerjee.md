Wanna listen to some [Nikhil Banerjee](http://www.musicalnirvana.com/hindustani/nikhil_banerjee.html)? I tripped over this [nice little collection](http://homepage.mac.com/sitar/FileSharing68.html) of some of his work. (You might have to rename the files to add ”.mp3” in order for them to play if you’re using windows…)

Also, check out this article by [Shubha Mudgal](http://www.sawf.org/newedit/edit10172005/reflections.asp) where she vents about talent search shows popping up in India claiming to be “classical,” but selling an incorrect or washed out version of the classical music tradition, and how she sees that as being a problem for the dissemination of classical music to a new listening audience. I’ve never seen the shows she’s talking about, but she makes some good points. Go shubhaji.
