I've been designing, developing and maintaining websites since 1997. I follow these basic principles:


* Websites should be simple, clean, and easy to use.
* A website's main function is to convey its content easily and accurately.
* Your website should be accessible on any browser using any device.
* You should have control over updating your content, and it should be easy.
* Loading pages and information should be quick.
* Your pages should be optimized for search engines in order to increase your visibility on the web.


My designs are simple and clean, with a main focus on their content. I usually develop websites on a [Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), like [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/), and include training for you and your staff so that after the development process has been completed you can manage your site's content. 

Because I provide web services after hours, I prefer working with non-profits and social justice-oriented folks. In my experience, I've found that most non-profits and activists are too busy changing the world to worry about creating and updating their websites. I'll work to make sure you're proud to put your domain on your business cards and tell people to subscribe to your twitter feed. 

Check out my [portfolio](/tech) and [resume](/resume), and  [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions, or just wanna chat about what [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com) is over some tea. I'd love to hear from you!!
