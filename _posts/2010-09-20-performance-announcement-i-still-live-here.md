I've been blessed to collaborate with some amazing artists on a performance work over the past year or so. I've composed sound for the ~30 minute work that will debut at Columbia's Dance Center as part of their Ten Year Celebration on September 25th. 

It's been a really great experience collaborating with Ni'Ja and the performers. Creating this work has taken me to places emotionally that I didn't even know existed. It's been hard, scary and really exciting all at the same time. There are moments in the piece of a brutal fierceness of one fighting for their own survival, and moments of tenderness and real vulnerability. See the info on the show below, check out a [sampler of the sound I created for the show](/i-still-live-here-sampler), and come see the show next Saturday!

<blockquote>
I Still Live Here is the premier work of Chicago-based African diasporic performance project, The Artisans of Alchemy (AOA).  AOA's founder and director, Ni'Ja Whitson choreographs this eclectic and gripping interdisciplinary performance work, that locates and expresses body memory; a gesture boldly traversing the collection of scars and narratives stored between skin. 

Supported by original compositions from sound artist nikhil trivedi, site specific performance for video composed by Whitson, and presented through expressive and dynamically moving bodes, the multimedia landscape of I Still Live Here questions our complicity and personal relationship to violence, connects the horrific reality of “corrective rapes” occurring in staggering numbers in South Africa, to shared histories of, struggles to overcome, and experiences within, collective trauma.
