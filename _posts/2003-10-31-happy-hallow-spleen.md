Whad up child’en,

I’m at work, and I’m not all dressed up for halloween. I’m going to Tina’s party tonight, and I might just go to the store and throw something together, or go with the ‘plant named robert’ idea. I’ll see what I’m up for when I get home…

so I’m listening to Pink Floyd right now, cause I’ve had this itch for a few weeks to listen to their stuff again. I swear, I never realized how out there and experimental their music probably was for their time. Granted, a lot of their music is just well-constructed songs, but they do a lot of jamming, too, and that’s where they really explore they’re sound space. They were probably what Aphex Twin and Squarepusher are in our our time. Just experimental sound. And it’s awesome.

When I was in high school, I was all about the rock, and in college I started getting into electronic music. I’ve always seen some parallels between the two styles of music, but nothing ever as strict as this where both types of artists had similar influences and perspectives on their styles of music. That’s pretty cool.

Plus, that gospel-sounding chick that sings backup on pink floyd records is awesome.
