Check out this [indian comic book](http://www.alanhunt.ca/images/nagraj/index.htm) where a superhero named Nagraj saves the day from an evil magician who captures Superman, Spiderman, and Batman in a futile attempt to take over the world. That’s what I’m talking about! I wish I saw comics like this when I was a kid, then maybe I would have turned out to be less cynical about the world. I’m not sure how, I’m just sure I would have. Lol.

The joy of life that is everywhere burns like an incense in my heart. And the breath of all things plays on my life as on a pipe of reeds."—Rabindranath Tagore
