Ever since I redesigned my site, my pics section has been down. Rather than putting the pictures up using the same system I was using before&#8212;where I had to manually resize, name, and upload images&#8212;I wanted to take advantage of some open source software out there to make that section easier to work with. I went with photostack, whose major feature among many that sold me was that I could zip pictures up into one file, and upload them through a web interface as a new album. It'll create the thumbnails and everything required for the SWEEEEEET interface from there, which also uses [Lightbox JS](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), which is freakin awesome. I love technology. Now I just have to get a camera that works so I can start taking pictures again. It's on.
