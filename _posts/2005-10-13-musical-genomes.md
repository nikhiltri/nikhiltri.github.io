Check out [this article](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB112784146741053451-3MGSTZEw0NXWUJb9kzlmMXcTues_20061006.html?mod=blogs) on a new approach [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/)’s taking on building personalized a radio station. Most other sites give recommendation by saying “nikhil like’s The Roots, here are some other CDs that people who purchased ‘Illadelph Halflife’ also purchased.” But instead of making recommendations based on similar buying habits, they analyze each song based on 400 characteristics to build what they call a ‘musical genome’ for every song in the library, and recommend you music based on other songs with similar genomes. Crazy, huh? I think that’s FUCKING AWESOME.
