In fall of 2010 I created these instructional posters based on the idea of a person who was a line drawing and transitioned to  three-dimensions. I was interested in exploring the idea of not feeling comfortable in one's own body expressed through the movements we make everyday made difficult, nearly impossible for this fantastical person. This was part a series that included a [short story](/body) and a sound piece.
