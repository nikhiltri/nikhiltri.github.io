Full website design and development

I served on the board of  DePaul University's South Asian Student Association in various positions over a few years, creating and maintaining their first website. The organization brought together students of the many cultural backgrounds of South Asia to cultivate leaders, raise awareness of social, political and cultural issues pertaining to South Asia, and provide opportunities to address those issues. The front page of the site randomly showed one of four compelling photographs that represented different aspects of South Asia, that then brought the users to the main content of the site.
