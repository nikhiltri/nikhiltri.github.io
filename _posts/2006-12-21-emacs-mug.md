[This](http://www.cafepress.com/geekcheat.13045051)... is _awesome_. I saw a buddy at work walking around with this mug, and it's awesome. [Emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) is a text editor I use when working on code on Linux, and there are a ton of features it has to make work easier, and this mug is a dandy little reference to some of this features. I know, I'm a dork, but this mug is _awesome_.

I heard a few tracks off [Ghostface Killah's](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3637-fishscale/) new album today, and it sounds HOT. I do still buy cds, so I might just pick that one up.
