A group of 16 people, including myself, performed a choreographed bhangra for one of the two national bhangra competitions at the time [Bhangra Fusion](https://www.facebook.com/bhangrafusion). The lead choreographer and I designed a stage set for the dance, which included a base platform that was 4’ high, 8’ wide and 3’ deep made out of 2×4’s and plywood, and we painted the front of it with latex paint to look like a tractor with words on the right side of the tractor actually saying ‘Chicago’ in Punjabi. On top of this base platform were two people holding another platform on their shoulders, and standing on top of that THAT platform, was me--about 20' in the air! All the outfits were designed by us and made by a woman on our team. We danced with dandas (long sticks) that we painted stripes on with silver cloth.
