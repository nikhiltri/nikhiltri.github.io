In The Masrayana, the main character is trying to undo the incorrect issuance of a death certificate in his name. One way he’s tries to undo this is by getting arrested for committing a crime, and having a police report filled out in his name, so that his name could be on an official record and the government would have to prove that he’s actually alive. To do this, he steals fruit from a fruit seller to try and get himself arrested.

Check out the bag that he’s using. It’s a juut bag, like potato-sack material, and it says ‘say no to plastic’ on it in Hindi. This bag was made by [Karm Marg](http://www.karmmarg.org/), the commune for street kids just outside of Delhi that I volunteered at two years ago, and this was their Chicago deput. Hell yea!!
