2013 was another big year for me, from taking better care of myself, growing in my work and enjoying life. Here are some of the highlights.


* I spent a lot of time in nature this year, and felt overall more connected with the cycles of the seasons and the moon. My partner and I bought ourselves a tent this year, and we went camping 5 times--twice in Wisconsin, twice in Michigan and once in Ohio. We also went on day hikes throughout the year and explored some parks in the Chicago area. We checked out [Pulaski Woods](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215153281407175295246.00048909fed9ce535cb5c&msa=0), [Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore](http://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm), [Lake Kegonsa State Park](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/lakekegonsa/), [Salt Creek Trail](http://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-creek-greenway-trail-elmhurst), [Chain O' Lakes State Park](http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/landmgt/parks/r2/chaino.htm), and of course Chicago's [Lakefront Trail](http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/The-Lakefront-Trail/454/). We hiked and swam in caves at Parque Nacional del Este in Dominican Republic. We went stargazing at [Yerkes Observatory](http://astro.uchicago.edu/yerkes/) in Wisconsin.

* A lot happened in my social justice world this year. A dear leader in my South Asian arts and political community [passed away](/2013/02/11/in-memory-of-aparna-sharma). I became a Rape Crisis Counsellor. I started a feminist book group with some of my guy friends. After the factory collapse in Bangladesh, I [made a map](/2013/05/19/where-my-clothes-were-made) documenting where my clothes were made. And I took a selfie with Arudhati Roy.

* I took good care of myself physically this year. I started learning yoga in the fall of 2012, and I continued doing 30 minutes of it every morning this year. I wasn't consistent with it, but it did happen. I also did some runs with a friend from New York--a [10k trail run](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mayday-mayday-mayday-5k-10k-15k-trail-races-tickets-4826998683) in the Chicago suburbs, a [10k in Connecticut](http://www.active.com/old-lyme-ct/running/bound-for-the-sound-10k-and-5k-for-education-2013), and a [5 mile run in Pennsylvania](http://www.active.com/philadelphia-pa/running/fairmount-park-turkey-trot-2013) on Thanksgiving morning.

* I wrote a song this year. It was a sad, personal song about growing up as a child of immigrants. I haven't shared it with many people, so I don't have anything to post. Maybe in 2014.

* I became a beach person this year. I never really learned what to do on a beach. It may sound weird, but between not learning how to swim until my late teens, and never spending time at the water growing up, I just never *got it*. But this year, I got it. At my cousins wedding in Dominican Republic, I spent entire days on the beach--swimming and splashing around in the waves, sitting in the sun, and grabbing meals when I got hungry. That was it. When I was in Florida for Christmas and when we went camping, we made it a point to get into the water. And it was amazing.

* I've always took my finances seriously, but this year my partner and I started documenting all our expenses, and started making some long-term plans to pay off our loans and increase our savings. I paid off my student loans this year. And I started doing freelance work for [small library websites](http://lishost.org/).

* My halloween costume made it onto [Angry Asian Man](http://blog.angryasianman.com/2013/11/your-halloween-costumes-part-three.html). And a museum colleague made this amazing animated GIF of me.
