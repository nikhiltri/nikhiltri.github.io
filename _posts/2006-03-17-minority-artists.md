Check out this essay about another fellow [minority artist’s experience](http://www.indiacurrents.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=011d4947e43812a9a7ff71fd94abe93e). True words, my friend, true words:

> 
> "And here is what I’ve learned: As minority artists, we must create opportunities for ourselves and for one another.
> 
> We create opportunities by simply doing the artistic work faithfully despite the obstacles. And doing so with no promise of success. And doing so not for months, but for years.
> 
> The wise stonecutter knows that even though the stone may only crack on the 100th tap, it is really the 99 previous taps that make the breakthrough possible.
> 
> Like that stonecutter, minority artists must commit to the work—no matter how many doors slam shut. Because with every song we write, every dance we create, and every line we speak on a stage, we add a bit of momentum to the cause of minority artists everywhere. And this ever-increasing momentum will slowly create more and more opportunities for future minority artists."

What I’m reading right now:
> 
> [The Bone People, by Keri Hulme](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0140089225&tag=nikhiltrivedi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325)--Taking places in New Zealand, the characters in this book try to reflect the lives of a few native Maori people on the island country. It’s mainly about three characters. Kerewin, who’s an artists living alone in a six story tower that SHE BUILT, spending most of her days playing guitar, painting, drinking whiskey, and reading (now THAT sounds like a life...). One day she finds a mute boy, Simon, who somehow made his way into her library, and after meeting his father, Joe, they all sort of become friends. Kerewin’s character isn’t one that seems to make friends too often, so at first she sticks around just to find out what the deal with the boy is. He’s getting brutally abused by his father, he’s mute, but has no physical impairment to prevent him from talking, and he’s stalked by horridly scary nightmares. But after some time, all three of them end up developing a trusting friendship. It's pretty cool, and some random parts of the dialogue are in the native Maori tongue, with a glossary in the back to help you know what they’re talking about. Sweeeeeeeet.
