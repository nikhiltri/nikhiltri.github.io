Last night my moms and pops did a little puja up at my new place, to thank God the blessings he’s given me and my family, and to ask for his protection in my new place. It was nice, i finally got to use some of the incense I bought from India last December. Afterwards, my parents brought over some food they cooked earlier last night, so we heated it up in <i>my</i> kitchen, and ate with of <i>my</i> plates and glasses. It's on. Tonight I’m moving my bed and stuff in my cous’s van, and hopefully staying there tonight. Hells yes.

Khush, khush, khush. Bhagvan tane boooooooo khush kare (Happy, happy, happy. May God make you sooooooo happy). (c) My mom.
