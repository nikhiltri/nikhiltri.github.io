Hey Dudes,

So things the past few months have been pretty crazy. I’ve been going through some shit, and it sucks. But it's all good. It's hard not to feel like a complete asshole sometimes, but the right thing isn’t always the easiest thing to do.

So I’ve got some gigs coming up. If you haven’t heard about them from me yet, e-mail me and remind me to keep you informed. Check it out:

| Sexual Violence Prevention Month Kick-off 
| April 1, 7-11p 
| University of Chicago 
| Ida Noyes 3rd Floor Theater | 1212 E 59th St. 
——————————————————————————

I’m doing a piece of Indian tradition music with spoken word over it. I’ll be playing sitar, Maninder will be on tabla, and this girl I went to India with will be doing TIGHT poetry over us. It’ll be cool, and for a good cause. Check it out.

| Mars, Marriage, and Mass DistrAction 
| Closing Performance for the 
| 9th Annual Chicago Asian American Showcase 
| April 11, 7-9p, $9 
| Gene Siskel Film Center 
| 164 N. State Street
———————————————————————————

This will be the closing show for the Asian-American film festival going on in Chicago starting April 2nd. Check out the movies at http://www.faaim.org/ and then check out the closing night show. I’ll be playing sitar under a few spoken word artist, maybe a dancer, and doing a piece over a TIGHT beat with a saxophone kid, and a girl doing spoken word. It’ll be cool.

It's on.
