This weekend was busier than I hoped it would be, but I did a lot. Friday night, my buddy Jim had a 'movie in the park' party in his back yard. He got a projector, and showed [Best in Show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218839/) on the side of his garage. Lol, that movie's always hysterical. I've only seen it twice, but nonetheless, it's always hysterical. I saw a bunch of people that I haven't seen since high school, some i've known since [elementary school](http://www.asd4.org/schools/ful/index_ful.html). Crazy. Saturday I went to a karaoke birthday party a friend of mine was having, and ended up cutting out of there before they went to [Funky Buddha Lounge](http://www.funkybuddha.com/), which on a Saturday Night, I wasn't all too interested in heading up there. But it reminded me, on Wednesday nights at Funky Buddha, there used to be this REALLY TIGHT live soul band performing there. I looked them up again, his name's [Peven Everett](http://www.myspace.com/peveneverett), and I THINK he's still doing the night there. Check it out if you're interested, it's great music, and there's only a handful of people there, but everyone's dancing and having a good time.

	Sunday I helped a buddy move out of his townhouse. He was closing on a new place yesterday, so I helped him load all his stuff into a big truck on sunday so he was ready to move in the following day. It wasn't a massive workout or anything, but I was <em>exhausted</em> for the rest of the day. I'm getting old....
