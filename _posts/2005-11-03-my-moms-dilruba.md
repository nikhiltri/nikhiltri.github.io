I had dinner with my parents last night, and apparently, my mom played the [dilruba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilruba) for four years in high school. Crazy! She said that her final year, her teacher was encouraging her to go to college for music, but my mom thought it would be better for her “professionaly” to go into nursing, so she did. But that explains a bit about me, huh? I wonder if my mom picked the dilruba up today, what it would be like for her, if she’d be able to remember some of the stuff she learned in high school or not. That would be CRAZY, if I could have her teach me some of the music SHE learned. Hello! Can you tell I’m excited about the idea? :P

Here’s a picture I found on the web of a girl playing a dilruba. this is NOT my mom.
