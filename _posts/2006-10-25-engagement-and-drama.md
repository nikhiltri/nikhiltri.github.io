Saturday we're having a small engagement puja at my parent's house. Sheena's parents are flying into town tonight, Sheena and her brother come into town Friday, so right after work I'm picking her parents up from the airport, then the festivities will begin. It's on. Tonight we're proly gonna grab a bite to eat at [Lula's](http://www.lulacafe.com/), then maybe watch a movie or something. Tomorrow we're having dinner at my parent's house. Friday we're going out to eat with my sister and her fiance, then Saturday's the puja. Ooooh man! I've been cleaning my apartment like a mad man getting it ready for them to stay. Dusting things I've never dusted before, buying shit for my house I've never bought before, crazy.
 
But on the other side of the coin, we've been having family drama for a while now, and it's been culminating as of late. I've always been the "mediator" in my family, helping keep the peace between different members of my family at the sacrifice of my own well-being. About a year ago I decided not to do that anymore, and told everyone so. It's been hard, and the stressed situations aren't getting any less stressful. Cause my family's developed a dependency on me that they've already realized they can't depend on anymore, but now they have to figure out how to handle their relationships on their own, when negotiating and conversing under stress is not anything they've ever really had to do with each other. That's not a very pretty process to experience.... _Uuuuuuugggghhh_, why's this shit gotta happen _now_?
