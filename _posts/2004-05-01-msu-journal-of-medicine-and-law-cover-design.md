In the summer of 2004, I was asked to design a cover Michigan State University's Journal of Medicine and Law. Their editor-in-cheif felt in previous years, their journal covers were a bit plain for his tastes--almost always white with a black and white picture of their law school building on the cover, all-centered text stating the name of the journal, and usually a table of contentâ€™s right on the front cover. But they felt that the presentation of the journal should hold as much weight as its contents, so they wanted to invest in the design of a slick, eye-catching cover that would lend the journal more credibility from a first initial glance. The woman watermarked on the cover is part of the MSU logo, and the left side of her shoulder wrapped around the binding and bled a bit onto the back cover of the journal.
