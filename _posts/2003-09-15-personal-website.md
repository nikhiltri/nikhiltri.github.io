Full website design and development

My personal website serves as a way for friends, family, and creative peers to keep up with my creative work and my personal thoughts on the world, as well as a way to let business partners and potential business partners learn about my professional technical skills. Users can learn about the creative and professional work I have done, as well as things happening in my life everyday.

This site was developed on the [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com) content management system, and I did all the design and development of the website.
