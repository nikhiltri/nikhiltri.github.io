Hot-damn. Check out these [satellite photos](http://homepage.mac.com/demark/tsunami/1.html) taken before and after the tsunamis hit the coasts of South and Southeast Asia. My God, some of the small islands are completely gone, what used to be houses and green farmland is now just DIRT. I didn’t totally understand the full effects of the tidal waves until I saw these photos. Take a look at the roof of one of the houses in the before picture, then the after pictures. it's complete GONE. And that’s someone’s house. My God.
